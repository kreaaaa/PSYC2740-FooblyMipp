After the reading session, you will be prompted with a novel word <br> and asked to respond to it with the first word you think of. This experiement consists of three blocks. <br> In each block you will have a reading and a testing section. Let us begin.',

However, to ensure that you are reading carefully, <br> there will be surprise questions in the reading section.
