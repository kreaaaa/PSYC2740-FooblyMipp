Often we can learn in conversation or even by observing on television or in movies. <br> In this study you will read sentences that contain novel words. After the reading session, you will be prompted with a novel word <br> and asked to respond them with the first word you think of. This experiement consists of three blocks. <br> In each block you will have a reading and a testing section. Let us begin.',

However, to ensure that you are reading carefully, <br> there will be surprise questions in the reading section. These questions will ask you to type ANY ONE novel word <br> from the sentence you just read. When you have typed in your answer, press next to move to the next sentence.  ' ,
